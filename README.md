# Vtrack

[Vtrack](http://vtrack.hg.lan) is a Rails 4.1.4 application for tracking hourly activity in a
volunteer work setting.

## Origin

Written for the Recyclery Collective to keep track of volunteer hours.

## Todo

* Integrate scheduled Events with the hourly records

## Documentation

Vtrack is extensively documented via the [YARD](http://yardoc.org/) documentation tool. Additional documentation is also stored in the ```wiki/``` directory to reduce root directory clutter, but as a result can't be accessed by GitHub's documentation generator, and some links on this page may not work. To access full documentation, clone the repository, install the gems, and type

```
bundle exec yard
```

into the root directory. Documentation based on this README can then be accessed at ```{RAILS_ROOT}/doc/index.html```
